# AstroVision

Our model, AstroVision, demonstrated that by employing Knowledge Distillation with Meta’s Hiera and Google’s MobileNetV3‐Small, we significantly improved classification accuracy on astronomical images. The approach achieved an accuracy of 94%, outperforming the baseline MobileNetV3 model by 11% without increasing computational costs. This cutting‐edge model highlights the potential of lightweight, efficient architectures for processing noisy astronomical datasets and offers a promising solution to support future discoveries in space exploration.
